**View my personal blog [here](https://syome.vercel.app/), further I wish it will be developed to a community =v=**

## ­ЪЉІ About Me
­Ъј» Passionate about frontend development and the art of crafting responsive, intuitive user interfaces.

­ЪћД Almost every programming language I know is self-taught Рђћ  
I enjoy learning by building, replicating ideas as they strike, and refining them through experimentation.

­ЪДа What excites me most is tracing systems back to their fundamentals Рђћ  
exploring low-level mechanics and uncovering the "why" behind the "how."

This mindset drives the way I approach architecture, optimization, and tooling across the stack.  
And that's why I prefer to do all by myself.
