## 👋 About Me
🎯 Passionate about frontend development and the art of crafting responsive, intuitive user interfaces.

🔧 Almost every programming language I know is self-taught —  
I enjoy learning by building, replicating ideas as they strike, and refining them through experimentation.

🧠 What excites me most is tracing systems back to their fundamentals —  
exploring low-level mechanics and uncovering the "why" behind the "how."

This mindset drives the way I approach architecture, optimization, and tooling across the stack.  
And that's why I prefer to do all by myself.
