## ­ЪЉІ About Me

Passionate about frontend development and the art of crafting responsive, intuitive user interfaces.  
Almost every programming language I know is self-taught Рђћ I enjoy learning by building, replicating ideas as they strike, and refining them through experimentation.  

What excites me most is tracing systems back to their fundamentals Рђћ exploring low-level mechanics and uncovering the "why" behind the "how."  
This mindset drives the way I approach architecture, optimization, and tooling across the stack. And that's why I prefer to do all by myself.
